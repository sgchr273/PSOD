Out-of-Distribution Detection".

#Data arrangement
The three In-Distirbution datasets used in the experiments are downloaded and stored and then CIFAR10 and Imagenet further contain subfolders named id_data and ood_data where id_data folders of both of them contain the data files of teh respectuve datasets while ood_data contain ood datasets. The heirarchical structure of the three datasets is given below:





Some of the code has been borrowed from the repsitory of the paper "NECO: NEURAL COLLAPSE BASED OUT-OFDISTRIBUTION DETECTION".
